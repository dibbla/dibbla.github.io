## Hanabi game

"a co-operative game for 2-5 players that has attracted some attention in games research due to the role of hidden information, a restricted communication channel and need to model oneâ€™s fellow players"

Now trying to make a reapperance of [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06075) to have a primary understanding

## Timeline:
- MCTS on holdem poker
- MCTS on tictactoe
- (determinizationMCTS on poker)
- Hanabi gym
- Rule base on Hanabi

## Problems need to tackle
- MCTS maybe a demo implementaion--holdem poker

***

## Update:
- Done principle learning in MCTS&determinizationMCTS; page establish; primary reading on [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06075)
